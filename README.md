# CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions for automating CI/CD workflows in a software development project. 

## Workflow Steps

- **CD Workflow**: Deploys the application to Heroku after successful testing.

## Configurations
- **Secrets**: HEROKU_API_KEY stored in GitHub Secrets.
- **Dependencies**: Node.js version 14.
